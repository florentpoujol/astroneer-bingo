astroneer bingo

- script that generates a random grid of items (player must get all the items in a row, collumn of diagonal)
- grid size is customisable
- all texts are customisable (easily sharable via a file per locale)
- generation is random but seeded
- the pool of items that can appear is customizable, players can check or uncheck any item
  - items are listed per category, it's easy to check/uncheck a whole category
  - catagories :  resources, vehicles, modules, items, objects, planets, artifacts

- the seed takes the config (grid size + items) into account

- the config is saved in a cookie


how the config seed works :
concatene all the items ids
devide it by the number of items

itemid:number of consecutive items

a folder for images
image are named after the item
a list of items, an array of associative arrays

[
  { strID, category },
  { strID, category },
]


localization files :
languages["langcode"] = {
  strId: localizedString,
  strId: localizedString,
}
